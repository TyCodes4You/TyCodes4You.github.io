      <h1 style="font-size:40px;">Why We Came Back </h1>
      <img src="back2.png" style="width:250px;height:400px;" />
      <p><strong>87 Video</strong> is back, and we're bringing the popcorn. Are you
	   feeling nostalgic for some analog? Do you miss rewinding your favorite tapes? 
	   After years of being closed down, we've reopened, and we're giving you back all
	   your favorite hits of the 80's and 90's.</p>
      <p>Located right in the middle of the city, we're opening our doors 7 days a week 
	   to make sure you can pop in that copy of Rambo whenever you feel like it. Our prices 
	    start at only <strong>$5</strong> for rentals, so what are you waiting for? <strong>Get down here!</strong></p>
      
	  <p></p>

      <p>We got the scares, the love, and the bullets you need for any occasion on the couch!</p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Horror</strong>: You ever look around and wonder where the good Horror
		 went? So do we. Here at 87 video we have Jason, Freddy, and even Ghostface on tap 
		 ready to stick a bladed object into everyone in the room.</li>
         <li><strong>Romance</strong>: Look, we all have times when we need a good hug. Don't
		 feel bad. Take a glance at our Romance section for all the smootching you can handle. We
		 won't tell anyone.</li>
         <li><strong>Action</strong>: Obviously the most important part of any video store. From
		 Marty and the Doc taking a trip to the 50's, to Rambo blowing up half of an entire continent.
		</li>

      </ul>
      <p>And much <strong>MUCH</strong> more...</p>
