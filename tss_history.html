      <h1 style="font-size:60px;">From VHS to DVD!</h1>
	  
	  <p>VHS was the primary format of video from the 80's up until the late 90's. Some
	  movies and shows were still being manufactured in the early 2000's. VHS was in a 
      war we now look back on as the VHS vs Betamax war. VHS was ultimately the winner
	  for a variety of reasons. VHS also had much higher quality audio and video output
	  compared the prior formats such as Laserdisc.</p><br>

	  <h1>!!RECORDING!!</h1>
	  
	  <p>One other big thing that ultimately made VHS so popular was it's ability to
	  record anything off TV. During the 90's, all you needed was a VCR and a blank tape
	  and you could record your favorite show, movie, or even the football game to watch 
	  later.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, VHS was going to be obsolete. Once DVD came around, there was
	  simply no substitute for the time. This format offered VASTLY different visual
	  and sound quality when compared to it's former format</p>
